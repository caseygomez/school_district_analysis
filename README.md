# School District Analysis

This data analysis examined Charter and Public school data provided by the client. The dataset was large but we specifically examined information regarding student test scores, school types and school budgets.  

Overall the Charter schools had smaller budgets than the Public schools. Charter schools on average scored lower for math and reading in all grade levels except 11th grade. Both schools performed lower in math than reading. 

With more time I would want to investigate the amount budgeted per student in each school as this may give a better reference for the school budget compared to school size. I would also recommend that all schools increase spending in their Math department to improve Math scores.
